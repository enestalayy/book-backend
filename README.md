## Schema Details

### Collections

#### User Collection
- Stores user information including personal details and relationships with books
- Contains publisher information if the user is also a publisher
- Tracks both written and read books

#### Book Collection
- Stores book information including metadata and relationships
- Tracks readers and author information
- Contains embedded publisher information

#### Comment Collection
- Stores user reviews and ratings for books
- Links users with their book reviews

### Publisher Status Enumeration
The following status values are available for publishers:
- `pending`: Awaiting approval
- `approved`: Active publisher
- `rejected`: Publisher application denied
- `suspended`: Temporarily suspended publisher

### Key Relationships

1. **User - Publisher Relationship**
   - Each user can optionally be associated with a publisher (publisher sub-schema)
   - Publisher status is tracked through the status enum

2. **User - Book Relationships**
   - Authors: Users can write multiple books (tracked in writings array)
   - Readers: Users can read multiple books (tracked in readers array)
   - Bi-directional relationship allows for easy querying of both authored and read books

3. **Book - BookPublisher Relationship**
   - Each book has associated publisher information
   - Implemented as an embedded document for efficient querying

4. **Book - Comment Relationship**
   - Books can have multiple comments/reviews
   - Enables tracking of book ratings and user feedback

5. **User - Comment Relationship**
   - Users can create multiple comments
   - Facilitates user review history tracking

### Indexes
The following indexes are implemented for optimal query performance:
- `publisher` field in the User collection
- `publisher` field in the Book collection

### Data Model Features
- Timestamp tracking (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) for all major collections
- Use of MongoDB ObjectIds for document relationships
- Embedded documents for frequently accessed related data
- Array fields for many-to-many relationships

### Notes
- All timestamps are stored in UTC
- Book types are stored as an array to support multiple genres/categories
- Publisher status changes are tracked with timestamps

## ðŸ”’ Middleware Structure

The API uses several middleware layers for security and validation:

- **authenticate**: Verifies JWT tokens and user sessions
- **isAdmin**: Checks for administrative privileges
- **validate**: Validates request body using Joi schemas
- **validateParams**: Validates URL parameters
- **error handling**: Global error handling middleware

## ðŸ§ª Validation

Request validation is handled using Joi schemas for:
- User registration and updates
- Book creation and modifications
- Publisher management
- Comment submissions

Example validation schema:
```javascript
const createValidation = Joi.object({
  email: Joi.string().required().email(),
  password: Joi.string().required().min(8),
  firstName: Joi.string().required().min(2),
  lastName: Joi.string().required().min(2)
});
```
