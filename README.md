# Book Publisher API

A robust RESTful API built for managing books and authors, featuring comprehensive CRUD operations, authentication, and organized code structure. This project is designed with object-oriented principles focusing on modularity, maintainability, and clean code practices.

## üìö Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Secure JWT-based authentication
  - Role-based access control for different user types
  - Protected routes and endpoints

- **Author Management**
  - Comprehensive author profile management
  - Track author's published works
  - Author biography and contact information

## üèó Architecture

The application follows a clean, layered architecture:

```
Route ‚Üí Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Database
```

- **Routes**: Define API endpoints and connect to controllers
- **Controllers**: Handle request/response logic and connect to services
- **Services**: Contain business logic and database operations
- **Models**: Define data schemas and relationships

## üíª Technologies

- **Core**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB with Mongoose
  - JWT for authentication

- **Code Quality**
  - ESLint for code linting
  - Prettier for code formatting
  - Winston for logging
  - Helmet for security headers

- **Development**
  - Docker support
  - PM2 for process management
  - Compression for response optimization
